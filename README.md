<h1 align="center"> HEALTH INSURANCE CROSS SELL PREDICTION</h1>
<h6 align="center"> This project was based on a fictional company</h6>

This is a study project that aims to calculate the propensity of purchasing car insurance, considering pre-existing data from health insurance.

As a result, an interactive spreadsheet (GoogleSheets) was created that returns the propensity of each customer to purchase car insurance. With the savings generated by calling only the customers indicated by the model as being inclined to purchase car insurance, the profit increases by 30%.

**<h2> 1 - Business Problem </h2>**

<h3> 1.1 - About Golden Shield </h3>

Golden Shield is a reputable insurance company that has been providing reliable coverage to its customers since 1984. Founded that year by a group of industry experts, the company has grown to become a leading provider of insurance products in the market. In the early days, Golden Shield focused on offering basic coverage for **life, health, and property** insurance.  

Over the years, Golden Shield has continued to evolve and adapt to changing market conditions. The company has invested heavily in technology and innovation, allowing it to streamline its operations and offer more efficient and effective services to customers. At the same time, Golden Shield has maintained a strong focus on the fundamentals of insurance, such as risk assessment, underwriting, and claims management, to ensure that it remains a reliable and trustworthy partner for its customers. 

Today, Golden Shield aims to maximize its revenue and has decided to start selling **vehicle insurance**. To reduce the **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**, the company will adopt a **cross-selling strategy** by offering it to existing clients.

&nbsp; 

<h3> 1.2 - The business problem </h3>

For a more effective campaign, Golden Shield has decided to recommend vehicle insurance only to the clients who are **most likely to be interested in it**. This will enable the call center to make **targeted calls**to potential clients who are more likely to purchase car insurance. As a data scientist at Golden Shield, the task is to develop a ***predictive model to determine a customer's propensity to buy vehicle insurance***.

**<h2> 2 - Solution Strategy </h2>**
In this project will be used the Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining or CRISP-DM is an open standard process framework model for data mining project planning.

Every step od CRISP-DM wil be discribe bellow.

&nbsp; 

<h3> 2.1 - Business Understanding </h3>

The first step in this project is to select a sample of customers and survey them to determine their interest in the new product. Using this data, we can develop a model to predict each customer's propensity to buy car insurance.

Additionally, some preliminary research on the insurance market has been conducted to gain insights into the industry trends and customer behavior. The results of this research are documented in a notebook and will be used to inform the development of the model.

As this is a research project, response data has already been obtained from interested customers, which is ready to be used to develop the model. However, in order to do so, the data had to be collected in a SQL database.

&nbsp; 

<h3> 2.2 - Data Understanding </h3>

In this steps will be collected the data, and checked the following:

* Data description
* Exploratory data analisys and hypothesis validation


<h4> 2.2.1 - Collecting data into an SQL database </h4>
To collect the data, a connection will be made to the SQL database, specifically the PostgreSQL database used by Golden Shield company. A Python library that can convert SQL queries into pandas dataframes will then be used, allowing for easy manipulation and analysis of the data.

<h4> 2.2.2 - Exploratory Data Analisys and Hypotesis validation </h4>

During exploratory data analysis, several types of analyses are conducted, including descriptive statistics, univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis. The main objective is to gain a better understanding of the data and customer behavior, as well as to extract business insights.
